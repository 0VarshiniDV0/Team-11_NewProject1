🏠 Hostel Allocation System Website

 Team-11_NewProject — Hostel Allocation System

Description: This is a collaborative project by our team of three members. The purpose of this website is to allocate hostel rooms efficiently.
The system is divided into three main parts: "Login Page", "Dashboard", and "Logout".

🔐 My part in this project was to create the **Login Page** using HTML and CSS.I designed a user-friendly and 
responsive login form where users can enter their credentials to access the dashboard.

The goal was to create a clean and accessible login interface and manage the development using Git and GitHub with multiple branches.
